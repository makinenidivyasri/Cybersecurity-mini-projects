# Cybersecurity Mini Projects

This repository contains beginner-level, hands-on cybersecurity mini-projects completed to demonstrate practical understanding of information security concepts. Projects include:

1. **Phishing Awareness Simulation** – Created a mock phishing email to illustrate social engineering tactics.
   - A phishing email is a fake email from a malicious actor pretending to be someone trusted (like IT or a bank).

   - The goal is to trick you into revealing passwords or downloading malware.

   - You can identify phishing emails by checking the sender’s address, urgency, strange language, and unexpected attachments.

   - Never open files on your main system; use a sandbox or virtual machine to safely test them.

   - This mini-project demonstrates awareness of social engineering and safe email handling practices.

     
3. **ICT Incident Logging** – Logged and categorized sample ICT incidents including severity, description, and mitigation steps.
   - An ICT incident is any event that threatens computer systems or data security.

   - Incidents are classified by severity: Low, Medium, High, depending on potential impact.

       Example: 

          - Password leak on one account → High

          - Password found on dark web → Medium

          - Minor spam email → Low

   - Logging incidents helps teams track problems, respond quickly, and prevent future damage.

   - Each log entry should include date, type, severity, description, action taken, and status.

   - This mini-project demonstrates basic incident tracking and understanding of risk levels.

    
3. **ISO 27001 Quick Summary** – Summarized the ISO 27001 standard to understand basic information security controls and compliance requirements.
   - ISO 27001 is an international standard for managing information security in organizations.

   - It defines rules and best practices to protect sensitive data from theft, leaks, or loss.

   - Organizations follow it by implementing policies, controls, and procedures to reduce risks.

   - Companies get audited to prove compliance, which helps build trust with clients and partners.

   - This mini-project demonstrates basic understanding of information security management and compliance.
